Both Tauri and Electron are frameworks for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, they differ significantly in their architecture, performance, and use cases. Let’s go over each framework and compare them.

Electron

What is Electron?
	•	Electron is a popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications.
	•	It uses Chromium for rendering the UI and Node.js for backend operations, creating a standalone environment to run web apps as desktop applications.

Key Features:
	1.	Web-first Approach: Utilizes Chromium to render the UI, making it easy for web developers to reuse existing skills.
	2.	Cross-platform: Applications run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
	3.	Rich Ecosystem: Large community with many plugins and extensions.
	4.	Single Binary: Packages all the necessary files into a single executable.

Pros:
	•	Easy to learn for web developers.
	•	Large community and extensive documentation.
	•	Rich ecosystem of third-party libraries.

Cons:
	•	Performance: High memory and CPU usage due to Chromium’s overhead.
	•	App Size: Produces larger binaries (often 100MB+).
	•	Requires regular updates to keep up with Chromium and Node.js releases.

Tauri

What is Tauri?
	•	Tauri is a newer framework designed to build lightweight, secure, and fast desktop applications.
	•	It uses a system webview (e.g., WebKit, EdgeHTML) instead of bundling Chromium, reducing app size and improving performance.
	•	Backend logic is written in Rust, a fast and memory-safe programming language.

Key Features:
	1.	Lightweight: No embedded browser; uses the system’s webview.
	2.	Performance: Lower resource usage compared to Electron.
	3.	Security: Built with a security-first mindset, leveraging Rust’s safe memory management.
	4.	Small App Size: Binaries are often under 10MB.

Pros:
	•	Smaller app size and lower memory usage.
	•	Better performance since it doesn’t bundle Chromium.
	•	Highly secure by design.
	•	Integrates well with existing JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

Cons:
	•	Smaller community and fewer resources compared to Electron.
	•	Requires knowledge of Rust for backend logic.
	•	Dependent on system webview versions (e.g., older systems may use outdated webviews).

When to Use Tauri vs. Electron

Feature	Electron	Tauri
Performance	High memory and CPU usage	Low memory and CPU usage
App Size	Large (~100MB+)	Small (~10MB)
Security	Relies on developer practices	Rust ensures better safety
Ease of Use	Easy for JavaScript developers	Requires learning Rust for backend
Community	Large, established ecosystem	Smaller but growing rapidly
Web Standards	Bundled Chromium ensures consistency	Depends on system webview

Getting Started

With Electron
	1.	Install Electron:

npm install electron --save-dev


	2.	Create a Basic Electron App:
	•	main.js (Entry Point)

const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

let mainWindow;

app.on('ready', () => {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    },
  });

  mainWindow.loadFile('index.html');
});


	•	index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Electron App</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, Electron!</h1>
</body>
</html>


	3.	Run the App:

npx electron .

With Tauri
	1.	Install Tauri:
	•	Ensure you have Rust installed (Install Rust).
	•	Add the Tauri CLI:

cargo install tauri-cli


	2.	Create a Tauri Project:

npx create-tauri-app my-tauri-app
cd my-tauri-app


	3.	Build the App:

npm run tauri dev


	4.	Modify the App Logic:
	•	Update the src-tauri/src/main.rs file for backend logic (in Rust).
	•	Use JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend development.

Which One Should You Choose?
	•	Choose Electron if:
	•	You want quick development with minimal learning curve.
	•	You don’t mind larger app size and resource usage.
	•	You need a mature ecosystem and community.
	•	Choose Tauri if:
	•	Performance and app size are critical for your application.
	•	You are comfortable learning Rust or want more secure applications.
	•	You want a lightweight alternative for modern desktop apps.
